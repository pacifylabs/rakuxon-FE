/**
 * Which Commons image a university page may use as its banner.
 *
 * The hero comes from Wikidata's P18 ("image"), which for most institutions is
 * a campus photograph — and for a few hundred is the logo, because that is the
 * only image the item has. Stretched across a 16:6 banner and cropped to fill
 * it, a logo comes out as a wall of letterforms with the ends cut off, which is
 * what /universities/a-t-still-university showed.
 *
 * It is also the one image we are not free to publish. The API's rule is that
 * institution marks are never rendered: a free licence on the Commons file
 * covers the photograph of the artwork, not the trademark in it.
